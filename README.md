# Design Goal

While this is a generic EmulationStation theme, its been designed specifically
for the [ANBERNIC RG351P](https://www.anbernic.com/engappliance_sel_one?eng_ApplianceVo.eac_id=53),
running [351ELEC](https://github.com/fewtarius/351ELEC).

There are no guarantees that this theme will run correctly or display well on
other devices, operating systems, or otherwise.
